Some tools for propositional logic that includes a wff checker, a parse tree builder and a model builder.

Start with the starter.py.
  Just execute it normally as you would a python file and enter some sentence e.g. (a -> b). If the sentence you entered is not a valid wff of propositional logic, it will give you a message saying so. If it is a valid formula, it will produce the truth table of that formula.
