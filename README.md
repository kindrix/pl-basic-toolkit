Some tools for propositional logic that includes a wff checker, a parse tree builder and a model builder.

Start with the starter.py.

Just execute it normally as you would a python file.
You will be prompted to enter a sentence.
 
Try (a -> b) for example. 

If the sentence you entered is not a valid wff of propositional logic, it will
give you a message saying so. 

If it is a valid formula, it will produce the truth table of that formula.
